## ðŸ—‚ Data Sources

- **Dataset Name**: `supply_chain_data.csv`  
- **Records**: 1000+ rows  
- **Columns Included**:
  - Product information (type, price, defect rates)
  - Cost data (manufacturing, shipping, total costs)
  - Operational metrics (lead time, shipping time, production volumes)
  - Supplier, customer segment, and transportation mode

## ðŸ“Š Results / Findings

| ðŸ“Œ Focus Area         | ðŸ”Ž Key Insight                                       | âœ… Recommendation                                      |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **Product Revenue**   | Few product types (e.g., skincare) dominate revenue | Focus inventory and promotions on top performers       |
| **Shipping Costs**    | One transport mode (e.g., road) dominates cost      | Reevaluate carrier selection and logistics strategy     |
| **Supplier Load**     | Majority production from few suppliers              | Diversify supplier base to reduce supply chain risk     |
| **Shipping Time**     | Some products have longer delivery time             | Optimize logistics for high-delay SKUs                 |
| **Defect Rate**       | Certain products exceed 2â€“3% defect rates           | Investigate supplier quality and improve inspections   |
